# reminderapp
A personal app that I made to help me with reminders. It features three scheduling features, those being reminders, weekly scheduling, and habit tracking. The first feature is reminders, allowing you to set a reminder and time, which will be sent to you as a notification. The weekly scheduling feature is relatively standard, allowing you to block out your time in a typical workday, designed mainly for productivity/organization purposes and not necessarily for keeping track of events. The final feature, being habit tracking, allows you to set habits, which at a set time every day the app will ask you via notification if you've done. It will track this over time with a streak system, getting rewards to customize your avatar every week if you make it without breaking any habits. 

Speaking of which, there is also a character customization menu, allowing you to create a pixelart avatar representing you and style it with rewards you've earned via the various achievements. Some achievements include keeping up a week without breaking any habits, having more than 5 unique blocks in your weekly scheduler, etc.
